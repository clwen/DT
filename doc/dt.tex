\begin{abstract}
In this report, I will explain what progress I have made on the DTour project. The work can be summarized in three parts: tarnsferring GPS fixes data to venue attendance information, clustering demographic data and venue attendance data, and using demographic data to predict the venue attendace behaviour.

\section{Introduction}
This is time for all good men to come to the aid of their party!

\section{GPS to Venue Attendance}\label{gps_venue}
A much longer \LaTeXe{} example. 

\section{Clustering}\label{clustering}
We use KMeans and DBSCAN \cite{Ester96} to do the clustering.

\section{Prediction}\label{prediction}
We worked hard, and achieved very little.

\section{Future Work}\label{future_work}
2012 data. Most useful feature for prediction
